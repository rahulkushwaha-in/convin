                    <h6>Convin is a sales managers' Swiss army knife</h6>
                        <p>
                        Convin is a sales managers' Swiss army knife for coaching and call tracking. Having a library of key topics and next steps mentioned by each rep on each call helps streamline coaching moments and 1-1s, this keeps me from bouncing back and forth to programs and gives me more time to coach and help my team perform.

                        Convin helps our sales teams focus and be present in the moment of conversation because they're confident they can easily go back and review calls at a later time. It helps us as managers to be more thoughtful and structured about the way we coach and help reps progress their deals forward.

                        Convin makes reviewing sales calls super easy. It creates training libraries for new joinees to improve and I love that. It also sends instant emails to those getting reviewed for the specific recording.
